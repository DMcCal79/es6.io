/*Symbol is the 7th and newest JS primitive data type.  It's main purpose is to make
object properties that contain sensitive info private. The syntax is Symbol([description])
where description is simply a string that is used for reference and debugging and isn't
actually used to access the symbol. Symbols are also enumerable and won't show up when
running the for(in..) loop. */

/*In the example below, both wes and person contain different values eventhough they
both have 'Wes' as the descriptor. Running wes === person will return false. The
true "value" of a Symbol is something like a bunch of random letters and numbers
that are unique to symbol*/

  const wes = Symbol('Wes');
  const person = Symbol('Wes');

  const classRoom = {
    [Symbol('Mark')] : { grade: 50, gender: 'male' },
    [Symbol('olivia')]: { grade: 80, gender: 'female' },
    [Symbol('olivia')]: { grade: 80, gender: 'female' },
  };

  for (const person in classRoom) {
    console.log(person);
  }

  /*In the example below, Wes shows a work-around for displaying properties of an
  object that are Symbols.  Since the for(in..) loop will not work, you have to use
  Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() and pass in the object that you wish to iterate
  over. You can then map over the results to pull the values.*/

  const syms = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(classRoom);
  const data = syms.map(sym => classRoom[sym]);
  console.log(data);

  //My example:

  const hotelGuests = {
    [Symbol('Jones')]: {nights: 2, reservation: 'internet', payment: 'CC'},
    [Symbol('Garcia')]: {nights: 2, reservation: 'internet', payment: 'CC'},
    [Symbol('Smith')]: {nights: 2, reservation: 'app', payment: 'EFT'},
    [Symbol('Smith')]: {nights: 3, reservation: 'internet', payment: 'CC'}
  };

  const customers = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(hotelGuests);
  const payMethods = customers.map(customer => hotelGuests[customer]['payment']);

  console.log(payMethods);

  /*Using Symbol.for(key) allows you to create a symbol in the global registry
  list.  Using the traditional Symbol() will not create the symbol in the global
  registry*/

  //Create Symbol that can be accessed globally:
  const MLB = Symbol.for('baseball');

  //Retrieve the key name for the global symbol MLB:
  console.log(Symbol.keyFor(MLB));
