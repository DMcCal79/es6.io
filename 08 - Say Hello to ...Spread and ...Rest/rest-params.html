/*The ...Rest operator looks similar to the ...Spread operator but actually does
the opposite.  While the ...Spread operator 'unpacks' items from an array, the
...Rest operator 'packs' items into an array.  In Wes's example below, the first
3 arguments will be assigned to rate, tax, and tip respectively. However, any
arguments passed after that will be placed into an array called amounts.*/
  function convertCurrency(rate, tax, tip, ...amounts) {
    console.log(rate, tax, tip, amounts);
    return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate);
  }

  const amounts = convertCurrency(1.54, 10, 23, 52, 1, 56);
  console.log(amounts);

/*Another helpful use case for the ...Rest operator is with destructuring. In Wes's
runner array below, the first 2 items are assigned to the name and id variables
respectively. However, any items after that are assigned to an array called runs.*/
  const runner = ['Wes Bos', 123, 5.5, 5, 3, 6, 35];
  const [name, id, ...runs] = runner;
  console.log(name, id, runs);

  const team = ['Wes', 'Kait', 'Lux', 'Sheena', 'Kelly'];
  const [captain, assistant, ...players] = team;
  console.log(captain, assistant, players)

// My example:
function batting(player, ...results) {
  results.forEach((result,i) => {
    console.log(`${player} AB ${i+1}: ${result}`);
  })
}

batting('Kipnis','double','walk','home run','double');

//Another example:
const lineup = ['Lindor','Kipnis','Ramirez','Alonso','Encarnacion','Chisenhall',
'Gomes','Naquin','Zimmer'];

/*This funtion packs each plate appearance passed into an array called results
using the ...Rest operator.  Each batter in the lineup array is iterated over
and then the result with the coresponding i from the results array is returned.*/

function game (batters,...results) {
  return batters.map((batter,i) => {
    return `${i+1}: ${batter} outcome: ${results[i]}`;
  });
};

const openingDay = game(lineup,'single','double','SO','HR','flyout','groundout','single','groundout','SO');
openingDay.forEach(appearance => console.log(appearance));
