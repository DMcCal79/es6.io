/*The ...spread operator will take every item in an iterable and put it into a
new array. In Wes's example below, the featured and specialy arrays are combined
together to form the pizza array. In pre-ES6, you would need accomplish this by
using .concat like so:
  var pizzas = [];
  pizzas = pizzas.concat(featured);
  pizzas.push('veg');
  pizzas = pizzas.concat(specialty);
Using the ...spread operator allows for cleaner code with fewer lines.*/

  const featured = ['Deep Dish', 'Pepperoni', 'Hawaiian'];
  const specialty = ['Meatzza', 'Spicy Mama', 'Margherita'];

  const pizzas = [...featured, 'veg', ...specialty];
  const fridayPizzas = [...pizzas];

  const deepDish = {
    pizzaName: 'Deep Dish',
    size: 'Medium',
    ingredients: ['Marinara', 'Italian Sausage', 'Dough', 'Cheese']
  };
