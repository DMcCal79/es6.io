  /*You can use the ...Spread operator to spread arguements into a function. In
  Wes's example below, simply using inventors.push(newInventors) would result in
  the newInventors array being nested within the inventors array.  However, using
  ...newInventors will allow 'Musk' & 'Jobs' to be added to the inventors array
  individually and not in a nested array.*/

 array as arguments into the sayHi function.*/
