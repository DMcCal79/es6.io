/*Destructuring makes it easier to store object properties into variables. The
syntax is: const(or var,let) { property(s) to extract } = object to destructure.
Without destructuring,the example below would have to be written as:
const first = person.first;
const last = person.last;
const twitter = person.twitter;*/
  const { first, last, twitter } = person;

  const wes = {
    first: 'Wes',
    last: 'Bos',
    links: {
      social: {
        twitter: 'https://twitter.com/wesbos',
        facebook: 'https://facebook.com/wesbos.developer',
      },
      web: {
        blog: 'https://wesbos.com'
      }
    }
  };

/*Wes's example below shows how to destructure nested objects and also change
the variable name. The syntax for changing the variable name is:
const { property:new name to use for variable } = object to destructure*/
  const { twitter: tweet, facebook: fb } = wes.links.social;

  const settings = { width: 300, color: 'black' }  // height, fontSize

/*In Wes's example below, default values are being set for each variable. However,
if the property is already found on the object being destructured, then the
default value will be overwritten by the value found in the object. For example,
width would actually be 300 instead of 100 since it's found in the settings object.
However, height would be set to 100 since it is not on the settings object.*/
  const { width = 100, height = 100, color = 'blue', fontSize = 25} = settings;

//My example:
const fridge = {
healthy: {
	 fruit: {
		   apples: "Golden Delicious",
		     berries: "Blueberries"
       },
     }
};

/*This will pull the nested properties apples and berries and then change the
variable names to store them in to snack and breakfast. */
const { apples:snack, berries:breakfast } = fridge.healthy.fruit;
