/*You can return several values at once from a function by making them properties
of an object. In the this example, convertCurrency will return an object which can be
destructured into several variables containing the multiple values returned by the
object.*/
  function convertCurrency(amount) {
    const converted = {
      USD: amount * 0.76,
      GPB: amount * 0.53,
      AUD: amount * 1.01,
      MEX: amount * 13.30
    };
    return converted;
  }
/*Here,the returned object is destructured so that the multiple values returned
can be stored in multiple variables.  Since an object is being returned, you can
actually put the property names in any order when destructing and the correct
property/value pair will still be returned.*/
  const { USD, GPB, AUD, MEX } = convertCurrency(100);

/*When using default value arguments, you can pass them as an object by wrapping
them with {}. This will allow you to be able to pass in agruments in any order
since they're being passed as property/value pairs of an object.  You also don't
have to pass in undefined for arguments that you wish to use the default value.
For example, if I wanted to keep the tip at the default .15 but enter different
values for everything else, then I can simply just pass
tipCalc({total:200, tax:.15}{...}  Without ES6, I would need to enter:
tipCalc(total = 100, undefined, tax=.2){..}. Adding the ={} after the arguments
will allow you to be able to call the function by tipCalc() if you wish to keep all of
the arguments equaling the defaults. */
  function tipCalc({ total = 100, tip = 0.15, tax = 0.13 } = {}) {
    return total + (tip * total) + (tax * total);
  }

  const bill = tipCalc({ tip: 0.20, total: 200 });
  console.log(bill);

//My example:
function baseball({ab = 100, hits = 20, rbi = 30} ={}) {
 console.log(`He batted ${Math.round((hits/ab)*1000)} and had ${rbi} rbi's this spring.`);
};

const playerA = baseball({rbi: 70});
const playerB = baseball({ab: 180, hits: 60});
const playerC = baseball();
