/*In Wes's example below, a proxy is used to establish the way phone numbers are
stored(set) and retrieved (get) in an object.  The format for which the numbers are
stored and retrieved is accomplished by the use of regular expressions.  For example,
the phone number will always be stored in the 2223334444 format no matter how it was
entered.  However, the phone number will always be retrieved in the (222)-333-4444*/

  const phoneHandler = {
    set(target, name, value) {
       target[name] = value.match(/[0-9]/g).join('');
    },
    get(target, name) {
      return target[name].replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, '($1)-$2-$3');
    }
  };

  const phoneNumbers = new Proxy({}, phoneHandler);
  phoneNumbers.dominos = '7777778888';


//My Example:

const lockerHandler = {
  set(target, prop, value) {
    //sets the combination in 121314 format no matter how it was entered
    target[prop] = value.match(/[0-9]/g).join('');
  },
  get(target, prop) {
    //retrieves(get) the combination in 12-13-14 format
    return target[prop].replace(/(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})/, '$1--$2--$3');
  }
};

const lockerComb = new Proxy({}, lockerHandler);
lockerComb.combination = '12-1314';
