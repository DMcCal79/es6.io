/*Wes's example below uses a restaurant scenerio to demonstrate how sets can be
useful.  As customers are arriving to the restaurant for brunch, they are added to
the waiting list (the set titled 'brunch') using brunch.add('name').  Once the
restaurant opens, the order to seat the customers is then established by creating an
iterator(titled 'line') and then seating each customer by using line.next().value.  Each
time a customer is seated, the are removed from the iterator.  However, the original
set (bruch) remains unchanged. As new customers arrive, they can be added to the
waiting list (brunch) and later seated by calling line.next().value*/

  const brunch = new Set();
  // as customers are arrving
  brunch.add('Wes');
  brunch.add('Sarah');
  brunch.add('Simone');
  // restaurant is ready to open
  const line = brunch.values();
  console.log(line.next().value);
  console.log(line.next().value);
  // new customers arrive
  brunch.add('Heather');
  brunch.add('Snickers');
  // customers are continued to be seated
  console.log(line.next().value);
  console.log(line.next().value);
  console.log(line.next().value);

//My Example:

  const phoneQue = new Set();
  // customer calls in and is placed on hold
  phoneQue.add('Dwight');
  phoneQue.add('Jim');
  phoneQue.add('Michael');
  phoneQue.add('Stanley');
  /*customer service agents become available to take some of the calls on hold
  in the order that they are received*/
  const phoneAns = phoneQue.values();
  console.log(phoneAns.next().value);
  console.log(phoneAns.next().value);
  // some more calls come through the que and are placed on hold
  phoneQue.add('Angela');
  phoneQue.add('Andy');
  /*calls are continued to be answered in the order that they are received as
  customer service agents become available*/
  console.log(phoneAns.next().value);
  console.log(phoneAns.next().value);
  console.log(phoneAns.next().value);
