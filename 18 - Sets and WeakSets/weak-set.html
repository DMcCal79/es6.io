/*WeakSets are similar to Sets, however the only value type that they can contain
are objects.  Also, you can't iterate(loops,etc) over the values in a WeakSet. Another
difference is that WeakSets do not have a .clear method on them.  Instead, it will
garbage collect any value that has been deleted from the code.  In the
example below, dog1 is set to null and will then be automatically removed (garbage
collected from the code.  If I console.log weaksauce a few seconds after setting
the value of dog1 to null, then I will see that dog1 has been removed from the
WeakSet. */

  let dog1 = { name: 'Snickers', age: 3};
  let dog2 = { name: 'Sunny', age: 1};

  const weakSauce = new WeakSet([dog1, dog2]);

  console.log(weakSauce);
  dog1 = null;
  console.log(weakSauce);

//My Example:

  let car1 = { model: 'Chevy', make: 'Colorado' };
  let car2 = { model: 'Pontiac', make: 'TransAm' };
  let car3 = { model: 'Acura', make: 'NSX' };

  const garage = new WeakSet([car1, car2, car3]);

  console.log(garage);
  car3 = null;
  /*Waits 10 seconds and console.logs garage again to show that car3 has been
  garbage collected*/
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(garage);
  }, 10000);
