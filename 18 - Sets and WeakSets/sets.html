/* A set is similar to an array in that it allows you to store unique values of
any type.  However, each value can only be stored once and can't be accessed via
index as sets are not index based. Some of the most common methods on the set API
that I could use in Wes's people set:

people.add('Frank') - adds value 'Frank' to the set
people.delete('Wes') - removes the value 'Wes' from the set
people.clear() - removes all values from the set
people.has('Snickers') - checks to see if the set contains the value 'Snickers'(returns boolean)
*/
  const people = new Set();
  people.add('Wes');
  people.add('Snickers');
  people.add('Kait');

/*people.values() returns an iterator object that can be accessed using the.next()
method similar to a generator.  Each value can be iterated over one by one using .next()
as they would be using a generator.*/
  const folks = people.values();
  console.log(folks.next());
  console.log(folks.next());

/*The values in a set can also be iterated over using a for of loop.*/
  for(const person of people) {
    console.log(person);
  };

/*You can also declare a set by entering the a value array as a parameter directly
in the new Set() declaration rather than adding each one individually with the .add()
method.*/
  const students = new Set(['Wes', 'Kara', 'Tony']);

  const dogs = ['Snickers', 'Sunny'];
  const dogSet = new Set(dogs);

//My Example:

const tacos = new Set();
tacos.add('Chicken');
tacos.add('Pork');
tacos.add('Beef');
tacos.add('Fish');
tacos.add('Bacon');

tacos.delete('Pork');

for(let taco of tacos) {
  console.log(taco);
};
