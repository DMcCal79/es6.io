/*Constructor function for dog.  Always good idea to capitalize the name of the
constructor.*/
  function Dog(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }
  Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log(`Bark Bark! My name is ${this.name}`)

/*Creating new instances of a Dog using new in front of the constructor.*/
  const snickers = new Dog('Snickers', 'King Charles');
  const sunny = new Dog('Sunny', 'Golden Doodle');

/*Here Wes is adding a new method to the Dog prototype called bark. This method will
now be available to all instances of Dog through prototypal inheritance.*/
  Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log(`Bark BarkðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦! My name is ${this.name} and I'm a ${this.breed}`);
  }

/*Another example of a method being added to the Dog prototype that will be inherited
by all instances of dog.  The instances snickers and sunny now have access to the
bark and cuddle methods from the Dog protoype.*/
  Dog.prototype.cuddle = function() {
    console.log(`I love you owner!`);

//My Example:
/*Constructor function that creates Transformers.*/
function Transformer(name, faction, altMode) {
  this.name = name;
  this.faction = faction;
  this.altMode = altMode;
};

/*The instances of optimus and megatron are created.*/
const optimus = new Transformer('Optimus Prime', 'Autobot', 'Truck');
const megatron = new Transformer('Megatron', 'Decepticon', 'Cannon');

/*Adding a method to the prototype to be inherited by all instances of
Transformers.*/
Transformer.prototype.identify = function() {
  console.log(`My name is ${this.name}, leader of the ${this.faction}s.`);
};

/*Added another method to the Transformer prototype to be inherited by all
instances of Transformers.*/
Transformer.prototype.transform = function() {
  console.log(`I can turn into a ${this.altMode}.`);
