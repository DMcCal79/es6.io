 status has changed.*/

  }

 /*Displays the value of the orderStatus property the was established with the order
 setter.*/

}

const roni = new Pizza('large','thin','pepperoni');

// Another example:

class Bbq {

    this.meat = meat;
    this.side = side;
  }

  }

  set desert(choice) {

  }

  get desert() {
    return `Time to eat my ${this.desert}`
  }

}
const Dinner = new Bbq('ribs','beans');
