/*Instead of having to write achy.next() several times to manaully proceed
through the lyrics generator, you can use a for of loop to interate through each
yield.*/

  function* lyrics() {
    yield `But don't tell my heart`;
    yield `My achy breaky heart`;
    yield `I just don't think he'd understand`;
    yield `And if you tell my heart`;
    yield `My achy breaky heart`;
    yield `He might blow up and kill this man`;
  }
  const achy = lyrics();

  for (const line of achy) {
    console.log(line)
  };

  //My Example:

  function* pizzaPlaces() {
    yield 'Tony C';
    yield 'Home Slice';
    yield 'Double Daves';
    yield 'Local Slice';
    yield 'Conans';
    yield 'Nikis';
  }

  const pieTime = pizzaPlaces();

for (const pie of pieTime) {
  console.log(pie)
}
