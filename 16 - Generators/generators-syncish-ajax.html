/*In this example, Wes demonstrates how generators can be used to make ajax requests
that all need to fire in a certain order.  A possible use case would be retrieving a
specific post from a user account.  The first ajax request would find the user account.
The next ajax request would retrieve the posts from the user account that was retrieved in
the previous ajax request.  The next ajax request would then retrieve a specific post from
the list of posts retrieved in the previous ajax request.*/


/*In this function, the data is retrieved, then converted to json, then stored in a
variable by passing the data to dataGen.next() call.  For example, in the first yield
the data is converted to json and then stored in the const beers.  In reality, the urls
in this example don't really depend on eachother.  However, if they did then data in
const beers would then be passed in the url for the url for the next yield.*/

  function ajax(url) {
    fetch(url).then(data => data.json()).then(data =>dataGen.next(data));
  };

  function* steps() {
    console.log('fetching beers');
    const beers = yield ajax('http://api.react.beer/v2/search?q=hops&type=beer');
    console.log(beers);

    console.log('fetching wes');
    const wes = yield ajax('https://api.github.com/users/wesbos');
    console.log(wes);

    console.log('fetching fat joe');
    const fatJoe = yield ajax('https://api.discogs.com/artists/51988');
    console.log(fatJoe);
  }

  const dataGen = steps();
  dataGen.next(); // kick it off

  //My Example:

 function ajaxTwo(url) {
   fetch(url)
   .then(data => data.json())
   .then(data => jobSearch.next(data))
   .catch(error => console.log(error))
 };

 function* research() {
   //The profile yield retrieves my github account.
   const profile = yield ajaxTwo('https://api.github.com/users/DMcCal79');
   console.log(profile)
   /*The localJobs yield takes the location from my profile that was retrieved in the
   previous ajax request and searches by my location city on the github jobs board for
   JavaScript positions.*/
   const localJobs = yield ajaxTwo(`https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?description=javascript&location=${profile.location.split(',')[0]}`);
   console.log(localJobs);
 }

const jobSearch = research();
jobSearch.next();
