/*The nice thing about using a for of loop on cuts is that it would ignore the
newly added shop property and just interate over Chuck, Brisket, Shank, and
Short Rib.  Using a for in loop would iterate over everything inlcuding the
shop property as well as any functions that were added to the Array.protoype.*/

  //   console.log(cuts[i]);

  // cuts.forEach((cut) => {

  //     continue;
  //   }
  // });

  // for (const index in cuts) {
  //   console.log(cuts[index]);

/*The for of loop also allows for continue and break to be used.  This is great
since you can't use break or continue with forEach. */

//My example:
  const cookies = ['chocolate', 'PB', 'Oatmeal'];
  cookies.hello = function(){console.log('Hello');};

/*Using the for of loop here will only interate over chocolate, PB, and Oatmeal.
It will ignore the hello function property that was added.*/
