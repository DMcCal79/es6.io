  object. This is because 'this' does not get re-bound within the funtion with
  arrow functions. Instead, 'this' is inherited from the parent scope. Here
  it's better to use funtion(){..} so that 'this' can be re-bound within the
  function.*/

  /*Similar situation here as above. Using an arrow function here would result
  in 'this' referencing the window object since 'this' can't be re-bound within an
  arrow function. With arrow functions, 'this' is inherited from the parent scope.
  Using score:function(){...} (or score() as written here) would be the way to
  go.*/

  /*Again, using an arrow function in the summarize method would result in
  'this' referencing the window object since 'this' can't be re-bound within an
  arrow function. You would again use funtion(){...} so that 'this' can be
  re-bound within the function and point to the object instead of the window.*/
