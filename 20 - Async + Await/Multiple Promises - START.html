      /*In this example, Wes is shows several different ways to to async & await to
      fire multiple fetch requests at the same time. In the first example below, a .then
      is immediately attached to each to fetch so that the json can be returned in one step.
      Both fetch requests are then fired in the Promise.all and the json is returned once
      both promises are resolved. Both responses are in an array.*/

      async function go() {
      const p1 = fetch('https://api.github.com/users/wesbos').then(data => data.json());
      const p2 = fetch('https://api.github.com/users/stolinski').then(data => data.json());
      //Wait for both of them to resolve
      const res = await Promise.all([p1, p2]);
      console.log(res);
    };
      go();

      /*In this second example, .map is used to create the second Promise.all to retrieve
      the json.  Instead of attaching a .then to each fetch, the initial data returned from the
      first Promise.all is mapped over and a new Promise is created with the .json() attached. These
      new promises are then executed in a second Promise.all and the json for both is again returned
      in an array which is destructred to the Wes and Scott varibales. */

      async function goTwo() {
      const p1 = fetch('https://api.github.com/users/wesbos');
      const p2 = fetch('https://api.github.com/users/stolinski');
      // Wait for both of them to resolves
      const res = await Promise.all([p1, p2]);
      const dataPromises = res.map(r => r.json());
      const [ Wes, Scott ] = await Promise.all(dataPromises);
      console.log(Wes, Scott);
    };
      goTwo();


      /*This third example is a hybrid of the previous two techniques. The getData function
      can take in an array of github names and then pass them to a fetch request to the github API.
      Each newly created fetch request is stored in the promises variable which is an array.

      Next, the promises array is then mapped over and each fetch request is returned
      with a .json() attached.

      Finally, the promises array is then passed into the Promise.all(promises) and the
      data returned is stored in the people variable. */

      async function getData(names) {
          const promises = names.map(name => fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${name}`).then(r => r.json()));
          const people = await Promise.all(promises);
          console.log(people);
      };

        getData(['wesbos', 'stolinski']);


    //My Examples:
    async function fire() {
      const myProfile = fetch('https://api.github.com/users/DMcCal79').then(data => data.json());
      const hans = fetch('https://api.discogs.com/artists/59656').then(data => data.json());
      const bundle = await Promise.all([myProfile, hans]);
      console.log(bundle);

    };
    fire();


    async function fireTwo() {
      const myProfile = fetch('https://api.github.com/users/DMcCal79');
      const hans = fetch('https://api.discogs.com/artists/59656');
      const bundle = await Promise.all([myProfile, hans]);
      const finalBundle = bundle.map(data => data.json());
      const [ daveProf, hansZimmer ] = await Promise.all(finalBundle);
      console.log(daveProf, hansZimmer);
    };
    fireTwo();

    async function fireThree(github, musicianId) {
      const myProfile = fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${github}`);
      const hans = fetch(`https://api.discogs.com/artists/${musicianId}`);
      const fetches = [myProfile, hans].map(requests => requests.json());
      const fetchesFinal = await Promise.all(fetches);
